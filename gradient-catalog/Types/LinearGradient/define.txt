Linear Gradient:
>> Linear Gradient is a smooth transition between two or more colors arranged in a straight line.
>> Instead of using one solid color, a linear gradient blends colors gradually from one direction to another.

Syntax:
linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);
>> This means:
>> start with red 
>> Gradually change to blue
>> Direction is left to right
>> also in place of direction we use degrees also
>> also we use more colors than 2
